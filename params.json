The ICAR package is intended to facilitate the distribution of cognitive ability measures which have been described in several locations as the International Cognitive Ability Resource.\r\n\r\nTrack development at http://github.com/frenchja/icar/, log issues or contribute ideas at https://github.com/frenchja/icar/issues.\r\n\r\n## Why Use ICAR?\r\nICAR is open-source software!  As such, in addition to the Personality, Motivation, & Cognition Lab at Northwestern University, it attracts bright, motivated collaborators from across the globe.  \r\n\r\nSecond, obtaining quality assessments shouldn't be an expensive endeavor.  Unlike other measures of cognitive ability, ICAR is entirely free - just respect the open-source license below.\r\n\r\nLast, your feedback and ideas help shape ICAR.  If you have critiques about existing functions, or ideas for new items and algorithms, you can engage us in a dialog using the [issues tracker](https://github.com/frenchja/icar/issues).  \r\n\r\n## Package Details\r\n  - based on [R](http://www.r-project.org/), an open-source statistics language\r\n  - freely distributed under the GPLv3 license\r\n  - developed and tested by the [Personality, Motivation, and Cognition Lab](http://personality-project.org/pmc.html) at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/) and collaborators\r\n  - used by the Personality Project's [\"Big Five\" Assessment](http://test.personality-project.org/)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nTo install the development version of `icar`, it's easiest to use the [Hadley Wickam's](https://github.com/hadley) `devtools` package.  To install or update, run:\r\n\r\n```R\r\n# install.packages('devtools')\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(repo = 'icar', username = 'frenchja')\r\nlibrary(icar)\r\n```\r\n## References\r\nCondon, D.
